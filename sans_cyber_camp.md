# **My Path into Cyber**
> *Lodrina Cherne* - Forensic Examiner

    Was introduced to people doing forensics
    
    DFIR
        Digital forensics Incident Response

    mobile predictive text
        saves what we are typing
        even if we use services that deletes sent messages, keyboard stores it.
    
    If phone is in airplane mode, and then restarted, mobile phone still shows what is buffered in mobile device
    some special tools can allow to see this information

    everytime a  pendrive is plugged in , soe hidden files are created in macos.

**Observe**

    When we open a protected document, how does the pc know that this file was.
    
**Test**

    Open an incognito tab, one incognito session based. Not window based

    computer history stores the recent websites, back button works even if internet is off. It has cached the sites to improve performance

## **Cracking Hashes to pwn passwords**

> *Jason Nickola*

    Start diggin into things, If you don't understand, then you are in the right path

    The hashes itself are not secure, some salt(a random text) is added with the password 

    etc/shadow file and windows registory stores hashed passwords

    Cracking via Wordlist
        Coolwordlstgenerator - cmd tool to generate custom wordlist
        Crunch - tool to generate passwords
    
    Space Engineers - game(mincraft but space edition)

    Mask Attack
        Instead of bruteforcing everything, try inly possible combinations or wordlists..

    Hashcat command line options (explore more)

    Police -> Detective
    everyone is a photographer
        we all take photos of everything
    
    Metadata
        is kind of adjective that describes a thing
        everyfile has metadata, name, location, size etc..
        
        EXIF Metadata
            data embedded inside a photo
            when the picture was take, camera used etc..
            most files will have geo tags, gps co-ordinates of pictures
        
        Fighting Rhino Poaching with Digital forensics
            A criminal was arrested with rhino studds, in the pictures from his phone, using co ordinates from photos they found the riho that was killed.
        
**Analyze image metadata**
    
> exiftool path/to/image.jpg
    
    displays all metadata 
    the gps lat lon are not searchable in gmaps
    exiftool also allows to edit metadata

> exiftool path/to/img -c "gps format"

    displays gps in gmap searchable format

    Do people hide data in meta data
        some people do, embedding data using some tools by criminals
